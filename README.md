# FixEscape

Since Minecraft 1.19, Mojang has broken the way the game handles keybind, and it doesn't looks like they are going to fix it.

Instead of using the emmited key, they use the physical key pressed. People that rebind keys are left alone on this.

For most keybinds its ok, you can remap them ingame. But you can't remap escape.

This mod adds a second escape key that is re-bindable on any key you want. So you can finally play the game again even if you're using `caps:swapescape`.

## Versions

This branch produce a jar compatible for 1.20.2 and up (maybe)


## Credits

This mod is inspired by [TheEnderCore's EscapeScreen](https://github.com/theendercore/EscapeScreen) for Fabric, but since these days I'm playing with Forge, I needed a forge version.

## Known issues

- The second escape does not work when focusing creative inventory's textfield. Not sure why, I'll take a look at this later
